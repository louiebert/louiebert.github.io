              My name is Louie Bertoncin, and I am a junior majoring in Computer Science at the Missouri University of Science and Technology in Rolla, Missouri. I love developing for the mobile platform and making new friends. Some of my hobbies include playing Ultimate, running, and coding. I'm normally involved in some sort of programming project, likely throwing myself into something I've never tried before. I live life in search of new challenges in order to improve myself and keep boredom at bay.

              My experience in the field of Computer Science consists of about four years of mostly independent research. Until I arrived at Missouri S&T, found it difficult to acquire a formal education in this incredible field, so I have spent a great deal of time teaching myself the ins and outs of programming. Some of the products this education has enabled me to do include:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Three consecutive annual releases of FRC Scout, a renowned app used by the FIRST Robotics community to gather and share information at competitions on iPads, with one of these releases receiving the honor of being featured at Apple's 2014 World Wide Developer Conference.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Cerner's first widely available public Android application (unsure about how much information I am cleared to disclose, so just this should be safe enough).
                </li>
                <li>
                  ChapterBuilder's iOS app, allowing Greek Fraternities and Sororities to more conveniently keep track of potential new members and recruit with ease, which served an audience of at least four figures.
                </li>
                <li>
                  An iPad application that allowed staff members of the annual Junior Robotics League – an organization similar to FIRST Robotics, but created and maintained by my high school robotics team's alumni (including me), and the competition is geared toward K-8th graders – to keep score of active robotics matches, posting scores instantaneously to a server for public access. This project has been three years running now.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>

              I first started learning how to program through FIRST Robotics while attending Lee's Summit High School. My senior year there, I participated in Cerner's school work program for two hours of every school day, working in conjunction with a team of professional engineers. I then moved on to the Missouri University of Science and Technology to major in Computer Science, where I can claim my current education status is. I am majoring in Computer Science and have taken several classes in C++. I am a sophomore at S&T (in case you didn't catch that from the top). I consider myself confidently fluent in Swift, Objective-C, Python, Java, HTML/CSS, and C++.
